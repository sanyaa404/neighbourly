# Neighbour.ly

A civic issue reporting platform. Citizens report local problems, upvote issues, and earn points. Authorities manage and resolve them.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # fill in all values (see below)
npm install
npm run generate            # generate Prisma client
npm run db:push             # create tables in your database
npm run dev                 # starts on http://localhost:4000
```

### 2. Frontend setup

```bash
# in the root neighbour-ly/ folder
cp .env.example .env        # set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
npm install
npm run dev                 # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

## Filling in `backend/.env`

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) → project → Settings → Database → Connection string |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) → OAuth 2.0 Client |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same as above |
| `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` | Leave as `http://localhost:4000/api/auth/google/callback` for local dev |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Run: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"` |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Any random string — used to grant authority role |
| `CLOUDINARY_*` | [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) → Dashboard (free tier works) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | A Gmail address |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Google Account → Security → App Passwords → generate 16-char password |

## Granting Authority Access

By default all users sign up as citizens. To make someone an authority:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/users/make-authority \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-admin-secret: myAdmInSecreT" \
  -d '{"email": "sanya.gera.ug23@nsut.ac.in"}'
```

They then switch to authority view using the role toggle in the header.
